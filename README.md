## String data encryption/decryption for node.js & io.js

This is a module for helping you **encrypting/decrypting** string data inside **node.js & io.js** applications, so for example in a **MEAN application** you could use this module to store only encrypted versions of your individual entity fields inside your DB and decrypt them when only when needed for display in the views.

### Usage

Using the module it's fairly simple, Just take a look at the example available in the **tests** folder to have an idea of how easy the implementation is:
